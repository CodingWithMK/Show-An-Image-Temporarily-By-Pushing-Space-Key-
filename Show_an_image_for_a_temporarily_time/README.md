Hello everybody,

Here is how you can solve a pygame problem to show an image for a temporarily time especially by pressing the Space key (or a key of your choice). I searched for a long time for a solution to solve this problem but unfortunately I did not found anything until now.
The way how it was solved in this code is quite logical. In my opinion it is the best way to define a separate function for showing the image and add it to the main loop. The actual keypoint here is that you have to define the "event.key" keyword for showing the image when pressing the key on your keyboard you have chosen.

I hope this code will help you to continue your projects and helps you to save your time.

Good Luck and have fun by learning code!
